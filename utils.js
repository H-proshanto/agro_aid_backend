    5.	Seed varieties: Pumpkin seeds come in different varieties, including hulled or unhulled. Hulled pumpkin seeds have had their outer husk removed, leaving behind the greenish-white edible seed. Unhulled pumpkin seeds have the husk intact and are often used for roasting and snacking.
    6.	Seed extraction: To extract pumpkin seeds from a pumpkin, cut the pumpkin open and scoop out the seeds from the inner cavity. Separate the seeds from the pulp and rinse them under water to remove any remaining pumpkin residue. Pat them dry before using or roasting them.
    7.	Seed storage: Pumpkin seeds can be stored in a cool, dry place in an airtight container. Proper storage helps maintain their freshness and crunchiness.
    Pumpkin seeds are not only delicious but also provide a range of nutritional benefits. They are a versatile ingredient that can be enjoyed in various dishes or simply as a healthy snack. So, the next time you carve a pumpkin, consider saving the seeds to roast and savor their delightful flavor and nutritional goodness.
